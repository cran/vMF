The **vMF** package implements fast sampling from von Mises-Fisher distribution using the method proposed by [Andrew T.A Wood (1994)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610919408813161).


I provide a [vignette](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ahoundetoungan/vMF/blob/master/doc/vMF.pdf) that fully documents the package. Moreover, each function of the package has a help page accessible using `?name-of-the-function`.
